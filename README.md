# YOLOv8-based CV Information Extraction

this project centers around employing YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to automatically extract critical information from CVs. My solution streamlines the process of identifying and categorizing key details like names, contact information, skills, and projects, enhancing the efficiency of CV review..

## Features
### YOLOv8 Object Detection: 
My solution utilizes the YOLOv8 model to accurately detect and locate specific classes of information within CVs.
### Multi-Class Detection:
I tailored YOLOv8 to identify various classes such as names, contact details, skills, and projects, providing a comprehensive view of the CV content.
